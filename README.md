# GoogleBookSearch

## Description

This project is of a search engine using Google Books API with a RESTful API setup. The goal of this was to convert it to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can search up books they're interested in and create a profile that allows them to save books. Viewing their personal saved books list they also have the capability to remove them. From this project I was able to apply coding concepts of GraphQL and build a project implementing Apollo Server. This project also helps to strengthen my understanding of other technologies such as MongoDB database, React, Node.js, Express.js and APIs.

This is what it looks like when you search for a book in the search bar. Each book has its own card that has a button to save the book.
